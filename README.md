Project Title: Flood Risk Prediction and Mitigation Using SVM and Real-Time Weather Data
Objective:
  The project aims to develop a flood risk prediction system using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, trained on key weather features such as rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. It integrates real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assess flood risk for specific locations dynamically.

Overview:
  This project combines machine learning and real-time data processing to predict flood risks and provide actionable insights for flood mitigation. The SVM model is trained on historical weather data, mapping weather conditions to flood occurrences. A Flask-based backend processes API data and communicates the flood risk predictions to a user-friendly front-end web interface.

Key Features:
  Data Integration: Historical weather data and live data from APIs for accurate flood risk prediction.
  Machine Learning: SVM model trained to classify flood risk based on weather conditions.
  Real-Time Predictions: Uses live weather data to dynamically assess flood risks.
  Web Interface: A visually appealing and responsive front-end with video backgrounds and CSS styling.
  Mitigation Strategies: Includes detailed insights and strategies for flood prevention and response.
Potential Applications:
  Flood-prone areas for community safety and planning.
  Urban planning to identify and address vulnerable zones.
  Disaster management agencies for rapid response and preparedness.
